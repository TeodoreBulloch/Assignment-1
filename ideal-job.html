        <p>• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</p> 
	<p>As a Creative Director it is your job to bridge together multiple departments to create a unified creative vision that fills the intended project goals. You essentially act as the authority over aspects of the game such as the gameplay, visual style, story, audio assets, cinematics and marketing materials. DICE is subsidiary of the controversial Electronic Studios, but they’ve developed many first person shooters that I love to play such as the rebooted STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT series. That part that’s most appealing to me about being a Creative Director is honestly the entire process of creating and developing a project. I love exploring all my creative possibilities, seeing what sticks and what doesn’t and trying to find more ways to be fresh and innovative. I want to slowly evolve these ideas and create a strong vision of what my completed product should look like. But the most important part is putting in the work to make this vision a reality, when I’m dedicated and passionate about something, I will put my blood, sweat and tears into any project to try and realise my ideas and see it through right till the end.</p> 
	<p>• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. </p>
	<p>Some of the minimum qualifications of this job title include:</p>
	<p>-	Experience in shipping at least 1 AAA title as a creative director </p>
	<p>-	+8 years experience in game development </p>
	<p>These qualifications are important as DICE is a well-respected AAA publisher, they need to make sure that those who manage their projects are of the highest standards and already comfortable to do what is asked of them. </p>
	<p>But in addition to these qualifications I need to be quite comfortable with public-speaking to represent the creative studios and also good with structure and documentation to maintain a high level of quality and process control. </p>
	<p>• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </p>
	<p>I have experience in using GameMaker studios </p>
	<p>I have had 0 years experience in professional game development. </p>
	<p>Although I have had </p>

	<p>• A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.</p>
	<p>This role requires a seasoned and experienced creative director that has already worked on publishing AAA games. This would be some </p>
	<p>I would like to get into the gaming industry, but I wouldn’t want to  </p>
