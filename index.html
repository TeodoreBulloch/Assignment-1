        <p>I’m half Filipino and half Australian. I was born in the Philippines but I’ve been living in Australia for pretty much my whole life so I’m pretty white-washed. The only word Filipino word I know is tubig, which means water and I only know that because it’s two English words stuck together. I graduated from Emmaus College last year and decided to take on a Bachelor of Information Technology here at RMIT.  </p>
