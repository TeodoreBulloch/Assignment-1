<p>Teodore Bulloch otherwise known as TeeJay</p>
<p>I was born in the Phillipines but I’ve been living in Australia for pretty much my whole life</p>
<p>I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
<p>I have lots of smart family friends who went there.</p>
<p>I love drawing, writing and learning about technology and its impact on the world. </p>
      <p>What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
These results are great tools that allow me to bring in further introspection onto myself, my personality, motivations and habits. Although the learning style test doesn’t really mean much on its own to me, I feel as if it complements the other two tests in terms of my behaviour. 
Although these tests aren’t 100% accurate, they roughly help establish where I am right now as a person and can give me some affirmation for being myself. But, best of all, these tests expose me to my fears and weaknesses, which gives me a greater idea on how I can improve myself to be a better person. 
Also one fun thing about these tests is that there is a whole community of people who like to type celebrities and fictional characters on this website so you can find similar types to yourself on this website: https://personality-database.com/
• How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? 
All 3 results didn’t reveal anything to me that was too unexpected, I’ve always felt like a reserved and self-reliant individual. My Myer Briggs type being an INFJ along with my method of learning both reveal that I like to be very independent and reserved, preferring to solve problems on my own. The test that revealed the most insight onto my current behaviours was the cognitive functions test. Being a 5w4 means that I value self-reliance the most, with my greatest fear being helpless or incompetent.
Although these results reveal I’m at my best when working solo, I’m going to try and take the extra measure in working with my teammates by not being so stubbornly self-dependent. I also need to realise that sometimes it’s ok to rely on or ask for help from my teammates and teachers for help.
• How should you take this into account when forming a team?
