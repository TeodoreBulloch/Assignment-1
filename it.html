        <p><b>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? </b></p>
	<p>My main interest in IT is programming and coding. My interest for the IT world was jumpstarted when I we used Scratch in primary school to make games and videos. I would push myself to learn more than we were taught in class and to make my own unique creations. Even after we had stopped learning Scratch I was still making more games. </p>
	<p><b>• Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </b></p>
	<p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always had a desire to create something of my own. I would enjoy playing games, but I would always have much more fun trying to design my own maps and mods for them. I wanted to create unique experiences while also creating something that logistically worked. I’ve continued to experiment in modding my favourite games, although I would rarely complete any of my projects it’s always fun to learn and hone my skills. This spark is what drew me into pursuing IT, </p>
	<p><b>• Outline your IT experience (if any). </b></p>
	<p>I haven’t really had much IT experience outside of high school, but in school I’ve written HTML/CSS with Dreamweaver to make websites, worked on RDBMS with Microsoft Access, created games in GameMaker and wrote Visual Basic in Visual Studios to make various useless programs. I’ve also had a little experience in actually using Excel in a real work environment when I had work experience managing invoices and transactions of customers at a Community Arts Centre. Most of this work was undertaken in Year 11 as I decided to take on Informatics a year earlier than everyone, so I’m perhaps a little rusty compared to most other fresh Year 12 students.</p> 
	<p><b>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b></p>
	<p>One of the reasons that I wanted to go to RMIT was because I’ve had plenty of successful family friends graduate from RMIT in similar professions that I’d like to get into. But the main reason I wanted to go to RMIT, was because it was in the city. Because RMIT is so far away from my house, I was given the option to stay at a family friends place once most of my classes are on-campus. After living my whole life trapped in a house of 6, I wanted some independence and responsibility just for myself.  </p>
	<p><b>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
	<p>The skills and knowledge needed for entering the IT workforce is a given for University. Although I am eager to develop these skills, what I’m most excited to develop is my independence and responsibilities. Getting used to Uni at first was a little overwhelming but it’s also been exciting learning about how this new environment works. With this course I also hope too find out what about IT I’m attracted to the most so that I have a greater idea of what type of a job in the IT field I really want.  </p>
