        <p><b>Overview: </b></p>
<p>The project that I’m making will be a 2-D top-down shooter game with a mix of tower defence and survival elements which will be called “Astral Endurance”. The game engine used to develop this project will be the public version of the Unity game engine which will utilise sprites and graphical images for its display. The primary goal of the game will be seeing how long you can survive against nightly hordes of abstract alien enemies. To defend yourself against these enemies you must search for resources to create various structures and weapons. </p>
<p><b>Motivation:</b></p>
<p>Most Tower-Defence games are designed to provide idle experiences to suit the needs of mobile users or those who don’t particularly need engaging fast-paced gameplay. Tower-defence games instead stimulate players by forcing the player to constantly think about how they choose to play, there is often an indefinite amount of time given between each round for the player to delve into strategical thought. For this game I wanted to create a gameplay cycle that shifted between the strategical thought and planning of a tower defence game and an intense fast-paced shooter. With this game I wanted to simultaneously engage the players ability to plan and think ahead and also their skills and ability to think on their feet in a quick-paced battle.  </p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>Gameplay Loop:</p>
<p>The player starts off by spending their daytime adventuring into unfamiliar territory searching for valuable resources. The player collects them in order to craft items to help fortify and arm themselves for the impending nightfall. Once nightfall commences the fractals will now start to spawn in hordes with the player needing to use their arsenal of weapons, abilities, and structures to defend themselves until the sunrise scares off the fractals. </p>
<p>In-depth Game Actions: </p>
<p>All items, abilities and structures are created from different types of nanobots, by absorbing valuable resources nanobots can created for different purposes.  </p>
<p>There are 3 different types of energy derived from resources include:</p>
<p>-	Electrical (For Hardware)</p>
<p>-	Chemical (For Matter Creation)</p>
<p>-	Nuclear (For Power)</p>
<p>With these different resources you can craft materials that can help you create walls, turrets and structures to defend yourself but also ammunition, equipment and abilities to fight off the hordes of the fractals face to face.  </p>
<p>Level Design:</p> 
<p>The player spawns in the centre of the map which is also the safest place point for the player to be. As the map continues outward from this spawn-point resources are more easily found, but also the dangers of daytime-fractals.  For this game I want to prioritise learning about the gameplay so by giving every player a unique level to them through random generation it would create variety between different playthroughs and give the players chances to be adaptive. </p>
<p>Gameplay Conflict:</p>
<p>The primary conflict of the game will be fighting against the alien fractals which will be controlled by AI. The player will be able to defend themselves through a variety of means such as creating walls and structures or by creating different types of weapons and abilities. For the player and the enemy to be on equal standing the enemy will have to be just as adaptive as the player. Such as if the player can create structures easily countering the enemies, there must be a type of enemy that can destroy structures easily to make sure that the player is constantly on their toes and adapting. </p>
<p>Visual Aesthetic:</p>
<p>The visual aesthetic for this game will be going for smooth and soft. To achieve this aesthetic the colour scheme of the game will heavily incorporate soft pastel colour schemes consisting of oranges and pinks. Because pastel colours have neutral tones and low saturation, they appear quite soothing and calming. To further support this gentle aesthetic the artwork won’t be constructed from sprite artwork despite its efficiency in creating quick and easy visuals. But instead, the artwork will be created in Vector Based programs to be able to capture soft and geometrically clean shapes. The only downside to using the vector-based programs is that I’ll have to simplify the design and detail of everything to make them easier and quicker to make. By making the enemies abstract shapes I don’t need to create as much animation and don’t need to have the same eye for consistent detail as I would for creating human enemies.</p> 
<p>Setting premise:</p>
<p>You are an astronaut sent to a possibly hospitable planet in a distant galaxy to help humanity find a new place to settle. But the trip goes horribly wrong when the ship is fired upon by some sort of alien lifeform. This causes your ship to crash land killing everyone aboard except for you. Fortunately, you’re not completely helpless against this unknown threat as the MERBIUS a vehicle capable of creating impressive nanotechnological structures survived too. You now utilise this technology to help defend yourself against the horrors of this mysterious planet.  </p>
<p><b>Tools & Technologies:</b></p>
<p>The software I will use to create the game will be the Unity Game Engine which free for individual users. Unity is a game-engine that already has important features such as physics, collision detection and lighting/shading already built-in. The reason I chose Unity over other game engines is that although it may not be the easiest game-engine to build in, it’s more powerful than other game-engines such as Gamemaker. Although I have lots of previous experience in using Gamemaker for various school projects, Unity just has much more potential for the variety of projects that can be made in it.</p>
<p>For the Graphic Design work Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator will both be utilised. Adobe Photoshop is an image editor. While Adobe Illustrator is a vector-based graphics editor that doesn’t utilise pixels unlike Photoshop which will allow me to make perfectly clean and geometric designs. </p>
<p><b>Skills Required:</b></p>
<p>-	In-depth understanding of Unity </p>
<p>-	Programming/Coding skills for creation of game mechanics</p>
<p>-	Graphic design skills for 2-D artwork and sprite construction </p>
<p>-	Understanding of game theory and level design</p>
<p>I have tinkered around with 2-D projects in Unity a couple of times before, but because I didn’t have any strong desire to make anything in particular I stopped fiddling around with the software quickly. Although I have used Unity a few times, Unity is very complicated and I have barely learnt anything so I will have to learn much more if I want to use the program to its full extent. </p>
<p>Although I haven’t extensively used C# or the Unity IDE before, I do have experience in using game design programs and programming languages such as Gamemaker, Visual Basic and others.  </p>
<p>I absolutely love using Vector Based programs such as Illustrator to create clean artwork and have been making art with it for several years. I shouldn’t have to learn much or develop my skills to much further to make the type of sprite-work I need for this project compared to the other skills. </p>
<p>Although I have never taken on any Game-Designing courses, I do have a strong interest in Game Theory and Game Design. I’ve made mods for some old games and even wrote up my own detailed schemes for my custom games in the past. I also love watching videos about dissecting game mechanics and how games function or can be improved. So, although I may not have a professional understanding of Game Design I have learnt it to a limited degree, but I have a passion to strong passion to learn more.  </p>
